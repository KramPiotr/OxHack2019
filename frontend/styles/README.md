This folder tries to keep all the resources in one place, so that it makes refactoring easy.  
Such resources can be text, color combination, palettes, images and so on.

**NB:** palette is useful to keep the design consistent. It defines combinations used across the app.   
For example, the heading `Text` should use one color, font, and font size. The `Image` component should use the same placeholder image.  
Define new palettes when rebranding the app.
